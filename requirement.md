## Write a function who take an array of username.

The purpose of this exercise is to create a function that swap two letters one time in a given username.
for example for the username joel, it can be swapped like this: eojl. In this case, the letter "j" was swapped by the letter "e".
If the letter is small thant another letter in username, so you will invert the two letters.
